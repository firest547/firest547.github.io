# What is Firest?

Wildfires are a pressing natural disaster impacting the entire world. People can benefit from a comprehensive visualization not only representing the wildfires but also their effects on air quality and connection with changing climate patterns. Data related to fire parameters, affected areas, evacuated areas, exist either in survey data form or via satellite datasets. There are also related resources that can be employed to better understand the impact of wildfires and its correlation with climate change, for instance, air quality index, smoke map, weather patterns drawn from historical data. In this context, we present Firest&mdash;a Tableau-based visualization of current and historical wildfires; published on the web for open access. Firest aims to integrate multiple variables of interest regarding wildfires in one resource, facilitating access to wildfire related information. The scope is currently limited to Canada.

## About the authors

We are a group of graduate students at the University of British Columbia (UBC). We constructed this visualization project virtually in CPSC 547 in Winter Term 1, 2020. 

## Land acknowledgement

As students of UBC, we would like to acknowledge that the land on which we study is the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam) People. As a visualization project on the land, we are recalling the unjust, racist, and colonial practices that have had a lasting legacy, and continue to create prejudiced obstacles for Indigenous peoples across Canada.
