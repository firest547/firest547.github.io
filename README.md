Wildfires are a pressing natural disaster impacting the entire world. People can benefit from a comprehensive visualization not only representing the wildfires but also their effects on air quality and connection with changing climate patterns. Data related to fire parameters, affected areas, evacuated areas, exist either in survey data form or via satellite datasets. There are also related resources that can be employed to better understand the impact of wildfires and its correlation with climate change, for instance, air quality index, smoke map, weather patterns drawn from historical data. In this context, we present Firest&mdash;a Tableau-based visualization of current and historical wildfires; published on the web for open access. Firest aims to integrate multiple variables of interest regarding wildfires in one resource, facilitating access to wildfire related information. The scope is currently limited to Canada.
